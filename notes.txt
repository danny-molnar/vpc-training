Okay, this is the notes on what we'll be doing.

1. Create backend.tf
2. Create provider.tf
3. $ terraform init
4. $ terraform plan (this one is going to say no changes)
5. Create main.vpc - based on the Architecture Diagram
6. $ terraform plan
7. $ terraform apply

NOTE: every project has to have its own unique key in the backend.tf. This is going to be a folder structure in the bucket, that we have specified.
BTW: the tfstates file has to be stored in the cloud, so it is considered bad practice if it is stored locally. 

8. Adding Internet Gateway to main.tf
9. $ terraform plan
10. $ terraform apply 

11. Adding subnets to main.tf
12. Adding variables in variables.tf and terraform.tfvars. Check those files for usage.

13. Adding the rest of the subnets as per Architecture Diagram.

14. Defining AZs main.tf
15. Adding NATs to main.tf

16. Creating new file with route table(s) - route_table.tf

17. Adding nat gw route table to route_table.tf

18. Adding ec2.tf with the EC2 instance and security group
    EC2 instance info was looked up in the console, by AMI. Look for the latest AMI and copy/paste the AMI name/ID

19. Checking out https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance for the data source addition.
